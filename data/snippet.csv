Secondly, mass punishment is never the answer. Should Israeli civilians be “firebombed” due to the way their government treats Palestinians? Should Americans be “firebombed” due to the way their government commits heinous atrocities across the world? Hopefully the answer to these is no.

I’ll start by saying I would *actually* like to change my view, however as it currently stands I feel so strongly disconnected from the mainstream left on this topic for a couple of reasons. (I’m American btw if that helps contextualize my argument)

1. Palestine is not a progressive nation with Western legal standards and beliefs.

They certainly don’t have a thriving LGBTQ+ community or robust freedom of speech laws. Yet at NY and SF Pride two weeks ago, the streets were flooded with those same LGBTQ+ members enthusiastically waving the flag of Palestine, while the flag of Israel was banned. Persecution of gays is not treated as a crime there, and is often encouraged. Violence is oft preferred over arbitration and sponsored by the government, Israel is likely guilty of this as well, however, the PLO’s charter was vehemently antisemitic up until the Oslo Accords, and its still common to hear “From the River to the Sea.” It baffles me that most Westerners don’t realize that’s a call for genocide.

2. Palestine is not a good-faith actor internationally is not an ally to America in any capacity. Contrasted with the fact that Israel is one of our most important allies, why would we support their enemy?

Palestine’s actions and rhetoric have consistently hindered peace negotiations and strained relationships with other nations. On the other hand, Israel has been a long-standing ally of America, with strong political, economic, and military ties. Israel has consistently fought against militant radicalism alongside the US, Palestine has continued to move in that direction in turn. Israel has stood by us in the latter half of the of the 20th, and 21st century in standing against virtually all of our enemies, geopolitically it only makes sense we do the same.

3. Palestine shoulders the blame for much of the conflict in the recent century.

Supporting militant groups, launching the attack that started the current war, continually rejecting peace offers that would reconcile a two-state solution, using women and children as human shields, sending ballistic weapons into populated civilian centers during peacetime, need I go on. 

4. The Palestinian people would no doubt prosper under different national organization.

I think what irks me most is when people exclaim “Free Palestine” without understanding the implications. Okay— the Palestinians should have freedom. We can agree on that, but at whose expense?
Hamas is two planes short of the Taliban and the PLO is rapidly becoming the most corrupt governmental organization in the Middle East. Neither have the capability to effectively govern an independent Palestinian state that wont immediately degrade into chaos. For the purposes of peace, Israel occupying Palestine is probably the most effective way to pacify the threat. Israel has a substantial interest in seeing a neutralized and peaceful Palestinian state on their borders anyway, whereas Palestine has always rejected the notion of Jews getting any sort of statehood. (Im also generally going to trust the soldiers who wear a uniform and follow rules of war versus the ones the rape and murder hostage while hiding behind children to evade capture)


5. Both sides are bad, Hamas is evil.

I can already anticipate the most common argument against my belief:

“The support is showing support for the Palestinian people, not Hamas.” 

See, I call BS. Hamas was democratically elected, they have popular mandate. Im not saying it damns the entirety of Gaza, what I am saying however, is that when Nazism was supplanted in Germany and *they* began an aggressive war, the vast majority of people weren’t standing in solidarity with them. And both the Nazis and Hamas were political parties brought about by contemporary crisis.

Nowhere in this text have i extolled the virtues of Mossad, Netanyahu, and the IDF. However, in terms of geopolitics, human rights, and common sense, Israel is by far the better actor to support.

le38014,1,"Lol. This is like being against animal rights, since wild animals kill people. Human rights aren't transactional.

And seems you didn't realize that the ICJ (highest civilian court on earth), declared basically that Israel is an apartheid colonizer state yesterday. This was after both sides brought in their arguments.

And based on this, Palestine has a full right of resistance, including through armed struggle to acheive statehood and self-determination. A Palestinian state is not a reward that Israel gives based on good behaviour.
